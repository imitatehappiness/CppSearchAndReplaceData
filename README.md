## About The Project

The program search and replaces data in templates in an arbitrarily nested directory of files and folders. To do this, it parses the directory, then replaces all occurrences of the specified templates in each file with the corresponding replacement text. The program works in several threads and informs the user about the work done. The configuration file contains information about the number of threads, the address of the root directory and an enumeration of templates and their replacements.
